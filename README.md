## Description

This is a React program that mimics a tap room. Users are presented with a menu of available kegs first thing. Users are able to select kegs to view the details of the beer within that keg. They are able to also purchase a pint (or multiple) and change the keg once it runs out. Users may also add a keg of beer if they so choose. A form is provided for this, kegs are automatically assumed to be ~124 pints in volume and it is assumed only pints are served. The program employs local state and conditional rendering to display the pages. It also uses shared state to communicate which keg is being selected and purchased/restocked.
